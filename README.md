## About

...

## Requirements

- NodeJS _`10.15.3`_ or higher

## Get Started

1. Start by creating a new npm project and installing this as a dependency:

   `npm init`

   `npm install ellie --saveDev`

2. Use the command line to generate sample tests and code to kickstart your project:

   `./node_modules/.bin/ellie whistle`

3. Run the sample tests generated:

   `./node_modules/.bin/ellie ./samples/ellie.conf.js`

4. Check out the list of [seeded steps](./docs/SEEDED_STEPS.md) available for you to use, all without writing a tiny bit of javascript code.
